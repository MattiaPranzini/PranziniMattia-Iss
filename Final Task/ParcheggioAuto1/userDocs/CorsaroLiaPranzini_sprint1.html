<h1>LABORATORIO DI INGEGNERIA DEI SISTEMI SOFTWARE <font size="5"></font> </h1>
</div>  

<div class="body"> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
 
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Automated Car-Parking</h3> 

A company intends to build an <i>automating parking service</i> composed of a set of elements:

<ul>
<li>A software system, named <em>ParkManagerService</em>, that implements the required automation functions.</li>
<li>A <tt>DDR</tt> robot working as a <em>transport trolley</em>, that is intially situated in its <em>home</em> location. 
The <tt>transport trolley</tt> has the form of a square of side length <em>RD</em>.
</li>
<li>A <em>parking-area</em> is an empty room that includes;
	<ul>
	<li>an <em>INDOOR</em> to enter the car in the area. Facing the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, there is
	a <em>INDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>weigthsensor</em> that measures the <em>weigth</em> of the car;</li>
	<li>an <em>OUTDOOR</em> to exit from the <tt>parking-area</tt>. Just after the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt>, there is
	<em>OUTDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>outsonar</em>, used to detect the presence of a car.
	The <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>, once engaded by a car, should be freed within a prefixed interval of time <em>DTFREE</em>; </li>
	<li>a number <tt>N (N=6)</tt> of <em>parking-slots</em>;</li>
	<li>a <em>thermometer</em> that measures the temperature <em>TA</em> of the area;</li>
	<li>a <em>fan</em> that should be activated when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, where <em>TMAX</em> is a prefixed value (e.g. <tt>35</tt>)</li>
	</ul>
	A <em>map</em> of the parking area, represented as a grid of squares of side length <em>RD</em>, 
	is available in the file <a href="parkingMap.txt" target="code">parkingMap.txt</a>:
	<pre>
|r, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, </pre>
	The map includes the positions of the  <tt>parking-slots</tt> (marked above with the symbol <k>X</k>) 
	and of the <em>fixed obstacles</em> in the area (the walls marked with the symbol <b>X</b>).
	<br/><br/>
	The area marked with <k>X</k> is a sort of 'equipped area' upon which the <tt>transport trolley</tt> cannot walk.
	Thus, to get the car in the <tt>parking-slot</tt> <ks>(2,2)</ks>, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> must
	go in cell <ks>(1,2)</ks>.
	<br/><br/>

	The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: <a href="parkingAreaConfig.js" target="code">parkingAreaConfig.js</a>
 
	
	<center><img src="./img/parkingAreaZone.PNG" alt="parkingAreaZone.PNG" width="45%" height="32%"/></center>
</li>	
<li>a <em>parking-manager</em> (an human being) which supervises the state of the <tt>parking-area</tt>
and handles critical situations<!-- by using a software system named <em>ParkMonitoringService</em> -->. </li>
</ul>

<div class="remark">
The job of our company is to design, build and deploy the  <em>ParkManagerService</em>.
</div>
<!-- and the <em>ParkMonitoringService</em>.-->
<h3>User stories</h3>
As a <bc>client - parking phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use a <em>ParkServiceGUI</em> provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  to notify my interest in <i>entering</i> 
my auto in the <tt>parking-area</tt> and to receive as answer the number <em>SLOTNUM</em> of a  free parking-slot  (<tt>1&lt;=SLOTNUM&lt;=6</tt>). 
<tt>SLOTNUM<k>==0</k></tt> means that no free slot is available.</em>

</li>
<li>If <tt>SLOTNUM <k>>0</k></tt>, I move my car in front to the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, get out of the car and afterwards press a <em>CARENTER</em> button on the
<em>ParkServiceGUI</em>. Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> takes over my car and moves it from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> 
to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>.
The <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> will show to me a receipt that includes a (unique) <em>TOKENID</em>, 
to be used in the <i>car pick up</i> phase.</li>
</ul>

As a <bc>client - car pick up phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> to submit the request to pick up my car, by sending the <tt>TOKENID</tt> previously received. </li>  
<li>Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt>  takes over my car and moves it from its <tt>parking-slot</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.</li>
<li>I move the car, so to free the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.
</li>
 </ul>

As a <bc>parking-manager</bc>:
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <em>ParkServiceStatusGUI</em>  provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>
to observe the <em>current state</em> of the <tt>parking area</tt>, including the value <tt>TA</tt> of the temperature,
the state of the <tt>fan</tt> and the state of the <tt>transport trolley</tt> (<k>idle, working or stopped</k>).</li>
<li>I intend to <em>stop</em> the <tt>transport trolley</tt> when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, activate the <tt>fan</tt> and 
wait until <k>TA &lt; TMAX</k>. At this time, I stop the <tt>fan</tt> and resume the behavior of the <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
Hopefully, the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the fan</ks> could also be automated by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>,
while the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the transport trolley</ks> is always up to me.
</li>

<li>I expect that the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> sends to me an <em>alarm</em> if it detectes that the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>
has not been cleaned within the <tt>DTFREE</tt> interval of time.</li>
</ul>
 
 
<h3>Requirements </h3>

The <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  should create the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> (for the client) 
and the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> (for the manager) and then perform the following tasks:


<ul>
 
<li><hr/>
<em>acceptIN</em>: accept the request of a client to park the car if there is at least one <tt>parking-slot</tt> available,
select a free slot identified with a unique <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.<br/>
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>, 
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager). 
If the <tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is already engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed 
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice). 
<br/>
  <li><em>informIN</em>: inform the client about the value of the <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.</li> 
If  <k>SLOTNUM>0</k>:
  <ol>
   <li><em>moveToIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>INDOOR</tt> ;</li>
  <li><em>receipt</em>: send to the client a receipt including the value of the <tt>TOKENID</tt> ;</li> 
  <li><em>moveToSlotIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>;</li>
  <!-- <li>accept another request (<tt>acceptIN</tt> or <tt>acceptOUT</tt>). -->
  <li><em>backToHome</em>: if no other request is present,  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location,
  else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em>.</li> 
  </ol>
 </li>
If <k>SLOTNUM==0</k>: 
	<ul>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if not already at home, move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location.</li> 
	</ul>
</li>


<li><hr/>
<em>acceptOUT</em>: accept the request of a client to get out the car with <tt>TOKENID</tt>.
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is free</k> 
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager).
If the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is still engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed 
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).

	<ol>
	<li><em>findSlot</em>: deduce the number of the parking slot (<em>CARSLOTNUM</em>) from the <tt>TOKENID</tt>;</li>
	<li><em>moveToSlotOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>CARSLOTNUM/parking-slot</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if no other request is present  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location; <br/>
	else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em></li> 

	</ol> 
</li>
<li>
<hr/>
<em>monitor</em>: update the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> with the required information about the state of the system.
</li>

<li>
<hr/>
<em>manage</em>: accept the request of the manager to stop/resume the behavior of the  <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
</li>

</ul>
<h4>About the devices</h4>
All the sensors (<tt>weigthsensor</tt>, <tt>outsonar</tt>, <tt>thermometer</tt> ) and the <tt>fan</tt> should be properly simulated
by mock-objects or mock-actors.

<h4>When using a real robot</h4>
No further requirement.

<h4>When available a Raspberry and a sonar</h4>
The <tt>outsonar</tt> could be a real device. We can simulate the presence/absence of a car.

    <h4>When using <k>only</k> the virtual robot or <k>no real sonar</k> available</h4>
Consider the new requirement:
<ul>
<li><ks>authorize</ks>: allow a manager to use the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> only if she/he owns <bc>proper permissions</bc>.</li>
 
</ul>
 

 

<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
During a meeting with the client the following definitions are clarified: 
<ul>
<li><ks>transport trolley</ks>: a DDR robot able to move a car. The car will be loaded on a platform placed behind or in front of the robot.</li>
<li><ks>home location</ks>: position where the robot starts when the system is started. Located in the upper left corner, facing south.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-area</ks>: the area where the robot can move and the cars can park. People cannot access this area. This area is surrounded by walls, except for an entrance and an exit.</li>
<li><ks>indoor-area</ks>: area where the car arrive, and the robot can take it. This area is equipped with a weight sonar</li>
<li><ks>weightsensor</ks>: device that can detect the weight above it.</li>
<li><ks>outdoor-area</ks>: area where the robot carries a car following a picking request. This area must be cleared by the user within the time DTFREE.  </li>
<li><ks>outsonar</ks>: device capable of detect if the outdoor-area is free or not. </li>
<li><ks>parking-slots</ks>: places where cars can be parked. The transport trolley cannot transit on these slots. </li>
<li><ks>thermometer</ks>: device capable of detect the temperature of the parking area. </li>
<li><ks>fan</ks>: device capable of reducing the temperature of the parking area. </li>
<li><ks>map</ks>: map of the area, the locations marked with the symbol X represents the walls or the parking slots, the location marked with "r" represents the actual position of the transport trolley. </li>
<li><ks>fixed obstacles</ks>: the walls. No other obstacles are present in the area.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-manager</ks>: human being which supervises the state of the parking-area and handles critical situations.  </li>
<li><ks>tokenid</ks>: numeric identifier that allows you to refer to the parking number and pickup the car.  </li>
<li><ks>robot</ks>: a device capable of moving by receiving commands via the network, as reported in
<a href="VirtualRobot2021.html#commands" target="web">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>.
 </li>

</ul>

Regarding actions (verbs):
<ul>
<li><ks>stop (of the robot)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is higher then TMAX, the parking manager disables robot operations. If the robot was moving, it will have to stop immediately. </li>
<li><ks>start (of the fan)</ks>: when the robot has stopped, the parking manager must turn on the fan.  </li>
<li><ks>stop (of the fan)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is lower then TMAX, the parking manager can turn off the fan.  </li>
<li><ks>start (of the robot)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is lower then TMAX and the fan is turned off, the parking manager can turn on the robot.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-area</ks>: the area where the robot can move and the cars can park. People cannot access this area. This area is surrounded by walls, except for an entrance and an exit.</li>
<li><ks>indoor-area</ks>: area where the car arrive, and the robot can take it. This area is equipped with a weight sonar</li>
</ul>



<h2>Problem analysis</h2>
<h3>Relevant aspects</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Create a distributed system consisting of six macro-components:
	<ul>
	<li>the (virtual) robot </li>
	<li>the outsonar </li>
	<li>the thermometer</li>
	<li>the fan </li>
	<li>the weight-sensor </li>
	<li>our application (ParkManagerService) which sends commands to the robot in order to satisfy the requirements</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>For the construction of the system we use the QAK meta model. The components mentioned above represent actors of the model.</li>
<li>Each context owns a set <k>QActors</k> that can interact with components working on a different node,  by means of the following protcols:
<ul>
<li><ks>TCP</ks>  : on the port specified by the <k>Context</k></li>
<li><ks>CoAP</ks> : on the port specified by the <k>Context</k> </li>
<li><ks>MQTT</ks> : using the broker specified in the <k>mqttBroker</k> declaration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Wenv, the robot can be controlled via the network in two different ways:
	<ul>
	<li>sending messages to port 8090 with HTTP POST protocol</li>
	<li>sending messages to port 8091 using a websocket</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
In reference to the communication with the WEnv you can rely on the BasicRobot2021 project which allows you to issue commands directly via qak. More information can be found <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.qak21.basicrobot/userDocs/basicrobot2021.html">here.</a><br>
The WEnv uses a request response model, however for some features of the application it could be convenient to use a dispatch type communication.
</li>

</ol>
<h3>Logical architecture</h3>
<center><img src="./img/arch1.jpg"></center>
The architecture can be summarized with the diagram above. The parkManagerService represents the core of the application and deals with other actors and entities.<br><br>
<ul>
<li><ks>ParkManagerService <-> ParkServiceGUI: </ks>The ParkManagerService communicates with the Client thanks to the ParkServiceGUI actor.
The relationship between these two actors concerns the phase of requesting entry and exit from the car park. It must therefore be able to handle the acceptIN and acceptOUT methods. Once the acceptIN has been received, the ParkManagerService will communicate to the ParkServiceGUI the number of free slots through the informIN status.
The user story provided by the client specifies that the customer will be the one to check the free slots and request entry only if the car park is not complete. As a precaution, this control must also be implemented in the ParkManagerService to prevent entry being requested in the event of a complete parking lot.
<br>
The ParkManagerService must also provide a receipt to the customer containing a unique TOKEN. It will be the customer's responsibility to keep this TOKEN, as it will be used to collect the car. The TOKEN must be constructed in such a way that it can be traced back to the slot id.
</li>
<li><ks>ParkManagerService <-> Trolley: </ks>The ParkManagerService must also communicate with the Trolley to issue movement commands. The use of the websocket could prove to be more flexible (as it allows to receive information emitted by WEnv in a 'spontaneous' way) and more efficient (as it reduces the protocol hierarchy).<br>
The trolley can be managed with the commands specified at <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/anatali/issLab2021/blob/main/it.unibo.virtualRobot2020/userDocs/VirtualRobot2021.html" target="web" >this link.</a>
</li>
<li><ks>ParkManagerService <-> ParkServiceStatusGUI: </ks>The ParkServiceStatusGUI must display the current system status to the ParkingManager. To do this, it communicates with the ParkManagerService and retrieves information on the parking status such as free and occupied slots, fan on or off, displays outdoor and high temperature alarms, robot status (idle, working, stop).
The ParkServiceStatusGUI is also equipped with a button that allows the ParkingManager to stop the robot (STOP state) and resume the execution of the robot.
</li>
<li><ks>ParkManagerService <-> Sensors: </ks> The ParkManagerService receives information on the parking status from the sensors (outsonar, thermometer, weightsensor). Once received, this information will be communicated to the ParkServiceStatusGUI.
The sensors will send an event or a message only in the event of a change of state; in this way the number of messages exchanged will be reduced with a saving of bandwidth. A cons of this decision is that the sensor will have to keep track of the previous state and check each time to see if the state has changed. However, the pros are more prominent.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>ParkManagerService state diagram </h4>
<center><img src="./img/stati.jpg"></center>
The client's specifications lead us to represent the state diagram as shown above.
The words indicated on the arrows represent the conditions of the change of state, if they are not present the change always occurs at the end of the state.<br>
If at a particular time the acceptin or acceptout cannot be executed (for example for occupied indoors or outdoors) the requests are put on hold.<br>
Additional features described by the client are:
<ul>
<li><ks>manage:</ks> that accepts the manager's requests to stop and resume the robot. In this case the robot must restart from the state in which it was stopped.</li>
<li><ks>monitor:</ks> which transmits information to the ParkManagerServiceGUI for updating the parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ParkManagerService GUI example</h4>
A possible example of a graphical interface that can be used for the ParkingManager is the following:
<center><img src="./img/guimanager.jpg"></center>
The figure on the left represents the current parking status. The occupied seats are shown in red and those still free in green.
On the right side there is:
<ul>

<li> the temperature in degrees and the signal if this exceeds the TMAX threshold (in this case the circle turns red)</li>
<li> the status of the fan represented by a CheckBox (when selected the fan is running). The activation of the fan is not the responsibility of the Manager, but will be managed automatically, therefore the Checkbox cannot be selected.</li>
<li> the outdoor alarm: if the output is not released within the DTFREE time, the circle turns red.</li>
<li> the status of the trolley: represented by a text field that can contain the 3 robot states (IDLE; WORKING; STOP)</li>
</ul>
In the lower center is the button that the Manager will have to press when the temperature is too high. If pressed when the button shows Stop robot, the button text will change to Start robot.

<h4>ParkService GUI example</h4>
A possible example of a graphical interface that can be used by the users is the following:
<center><img src="./img/guiuser.jpg"></center>
On the left side there are the useful details to enter the car park (in order):
<ul>
<li> the number of free seats (updated when the car is positioned on the weightsensor)</li>
<li> the CARENTER button which will be active only in case of free seats and adequate weight.</li>
<li> the token issued when parking is successful.</li>
</ul>
On the right side there are the useful details for exiting the car park (in order):
<ul>
<li> a text area in which to enter the TOKEN ID.</li>
<li> a button to declare the willingness to collect the car.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems identified</h3>

<ol>
<li><h4>Moving the car from the indoor area</h4>
When the robot picks up the car from the indoor, the car is outside the walls. In this case, particular attention must be paid during handling. A rotation of the robot in this position could cause the machine to hit the wall.
After a meeting with the client, he clarified that this can be overlooked.
</li>

<li><h4>Weight-sensor</h4>
To prevent an object other than a car from entering the parking-area and interfering with the system, it is necessary to establish a threshold below which the entry is not allowed. The value of this threshold will be decided in the following stages.<br><br>
Since in the user story provided by the client it is not specified how the weightsensor must interact with the parking phase, a possible solution is to show the number of slots available as soon as a car positions itself on the weight sensor. The pro of this decision is that it avoids answering requests for cars that are not on the weight sensor. It will not be possible to proceed with CARENTER requests.
The cons of this decision is that a person who is not near the parking lot with the car cannot know if the parking lot is full or not.
</li>

<li><h4>Dimensions of the car</h4>
To prevent a large car from occupying more than one parking space, it is assumed that all cars entering the parking area have a maximum length RD. So, they occupy only 1 cell of the map.
</li>

<li><h4>Stop of the robot during operations</h4>
In the event that the robot is stopped by the operator during a movement operation, the robot must stop in the position in which it is.
When conditions allow, the robot's operations will have to resume where they left off.
It is assumed that the customer waits for the robot to resume execution, ending the process.
</li>

<li><h4>Temperature > TMAX</h4>
Considering the automated management of the fan, it is possible that the ParkingManager, for a distraction, forgets to turn off the robot when the temperature is above the TMAX threshold. To avoid damage to the robot, it is advisable to insert an alarm that draws the manager's attention (hopefully visual and audible).
</li>

<li><h4>User into the car</h4>
The specifications provided by the customer do not specify the possibility that a user remains inside the car after pressing the CARENTER button. To avoid this, the button must be placed in a position away from the indoor area. In this way the user is forced to get out of the vehicle to press the button.
</li>

</ol>


<h3>SPRINT 1</h3>
As a first sprint we have introduced the following simplifications:
<ul>
<li><ks>no connection with the robot</ks>: the robot will not make any movement. The actions will be simulated considering a waiting time.  </li>
<li><ks>GUI not implemented</ks>: The parking manager and parking service gui will not be implemented in this phase. </li>
<li><ks>no thermometer and fan: </ks> these two devices are not considered during this phase</li>


</ul>It is assumed that the parking request is sent only if there is at least one free space. This filter will be charged to the GUI which will not forward any CAR ENTER type request in case of all slot are occupied.

Since the ParkManager is not simulated in this phase, the alarm is sent to the parkmanagerservice actor.

<h4>Logical Architecture</h4>
The diagram below concerns only the components considered in this SPRINT, and not the entire final system.<br><br>
<table style="width:100%" border="1">
				<tbody><tr>
					<td style="width:50%;">Our system, as a first sprint, is composed by two actor: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><ks>parkmanagerservice: </ks>this actor manage the entrance and the exit of the car to/from the parking-area, before performing actions checks the robot status. In this phase the robot can assume two different status (idle, working). Stop status is not handled now.</li>
<li><ks>weight sensor: </ks> this actor communicates with the parkmanagerservice to notify a car's interest in entering the parking lot. It performs weight control, preventing objects different than cars from attempting to enter in the parking-area. </li>
<li><ks>outsonar: </ks> this actor simulate the presence or not of a car in the outdoor-area. It also send an alarm to parkmanagerservice if a car stay in the outdoor-area more than DTFREE time. </li>
<li><ks>client: </ks> this actor simulate the actions of CARENTER and pickup of the car, including the car removal from the outdoor-area. </li>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h4>Executable model</h4>
A first executable model is available in the <a href="https://github.com/MattiaPranzini/PranziniMattia-Iss/blob/main/Final%20Task/ParcheggioAuto1/src/parcheggio.qak" target="web" >parcheggio.qak</a> file.<br>
This model represents a single customer requesting entry and exit of the car from the parking lot.<br>
The model is compliant with the specifications indicated in the diagram shown above, with the addition of the timeout state which allows to detect the occupation of the output for more than DTFREE time.<br><br>
In this model, as indicated in the chapter Problems Identified, the acceptin is invoked directly by the weightsensor, and subsequent communications directly involve the client. <br>b
To simulate the behavior of the sonar, the parkmanagerservice warns the outsonar actor that a car has been placed outdoors. Once this message is received, the outsonar starts a timer. If the timer reaches the DTFREE time, it sends an alarm to the parkmanagerservice.
When the car is removed, the client sends an event to the sonar which will take care of communicating the free outdoor status to the parkmanagerservice.

<h2>Test plans</h2> 
A first test plan consists in generating a log file in which all the operations performed are reported. The file must then be analyzed by a human being to verify that all requirements and constraints are met.

<h3>Workplan</h3>

<h4>Sprint 1</h4>
The first sprint includes:
<ul>
<li>Parkmanagerservice behavior with only one request (one client).</li>
<li>Interaction with weightsensor and outsonar.</li>
</ul>
This sprint will be completed in 2 working days and will be delivered on 11 July.

<h4>Sprint 2</h4>
The second sprint includes:
<ul>
<li>Addition of the ParkServiceStatusGUI.</li>
<li>Addition of thermometer and ventilator and respective communications (alarms, ...)</li>
<li>A first communication with the robot: the robot starts to follow the paths to reach the indoor area.</li>
</ul>
This sprint will start on 11 July and will be completed within approximately 3 working days.

<h4>Sprint 3</h4>
The third sprint includes:
<ul>
<li>Addition of the ParkServiceGUI</li>
<li>A first communication with the robot: the robot starts to execute the paths to reach the first slot.</li>
<li>Addition of the map to track robot location</li>
</ul>
This sprint will start on 15 July and will be completed within approximately 5 working days.

<h4>Sprint 4 (Final)</h4>
The final sprint will include the complete project. All functions will be made available and the system will be released.<br><br>
This sprint will be completed and delivered by 23 July.
