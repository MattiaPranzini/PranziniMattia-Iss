<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
 
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Automated Car-Parking</h3> 

A company intends to build an <i>automating parking service</i> composed of a set of elements:

<ul>
<li>A software system, named <em>ParkManagerService</em>, that implements the required automation functions.</li>
<li>A <tt>DDR</tt> robot working as a <em>transport trolley</em>, that is intially situated in its <em>home</em> location. 
The <tt>transport trolley</tt> has the form of a square of side length <em>RD</em>.
</li>
<li>A <em>parking-area</em> is an empty room that includes;
	<ul>
	<li>an <em>INDOOR</em> to enter the car in the area. Facing the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, there is
	a <em>INDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>weigthsensor</em> that measures the <em>weigth</em> of the car;</li>
	<li>an <em>OUTDOOR</em> to exit from the <tt>parking-area</tt>. Just after the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt>, there is
	<em>OUTDOOR-area</em> equipped with a <em>outsonar</em>, used to detect the presence of a car.
	The <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>, once engaded by a car, should be freed within a prefixed interval of time <em>DTFREE</em>; </li>
	<li>a number <tt>N (N=6)</tt> of <em>parking-slots</em>;</li>
	<li>a <em>thermometer</em> that measures the temperature <em>TA</em> of the area;</li>
	<li>a <em>fan</em> that should be activated when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, where <em>TMAX</em> is a prefixed value (e.g. <tt>35</tt>)</li>
	</ul>
	A <em>map</em> of the parking area, represented as a grid of squares of side length <em>RD</em>, 
	is available in the file <a href="parkingMap.txt" target="code">parkingMap.txt</a>:
	<pre>
|r, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, <bc>X, X,</bc>  0, 0, 0, X, 
|0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, X, 
|X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, </pre>
	The map includes the positions of the  <tt>parking-slots</tt> (marked above with the symbol <k>X</k>) 
	and of the <em>fixed obstacles</em> in the area (the walls marked with the symbol <b>X</b>).
	<br/><br/>
	The area marked with <k>X</k> is a sort of 'equipped area' upon which the <tt>transport trolley</tt> cannot walk.
	Thus, to get the car in the <tt>parking-slot</tt> <ks>(2,2)</ks>, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> must
	go in cell <ks>(1,2)</ks>.
	<br/><br/>

	The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: <a href="parkingAreaConfig.js" target="code">parkingAreaConfig.js</a>
 
	
	<center><img src="./img/parkingAreaZone.PNG" alt="parkingAreaZone.PNG" width="45%" height="32%"/></center>
</li>	
<li>a <em>parking-manager</em> (an human being) which supervises the state of the <tt>parking-area</tt>
and handles critical situations<!-- by using a software system named <em>ParkMonitoringService</em> -->. </li>
</ul>

<div class="remark">
The job of our company is to design, build and deploy the  <em>ParkManagerService</em>.
</div>
<!-- and the <em>ParkMonitoringService</em>.-->
<h3>User stories</h3>
As a <bc>client - parking phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use a <em>ParkServiceGUI</em> provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  to notify my interest in <i>entering</i> 
my auto in the <tt>parking-area</tt> and to receive as answer the number <em>SLOTNUM</em> of a  free parking-slot  (<tt>1&lt;=SLOTNUM&lt;=6</tt>). 
<tt>SLOTNUM<k>==0</k></tt> means that no free slot is available.</em>

</li>
<li>If <tt>SLOTNUM <k>>0</k></tt>, I move my car in front to the <tt>INDOOR</tt>, get out of the car and afterwards press a <em>CARENTER</em> button on the
<em>ParkServiceGUI</em>. Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt> takes over my car and moves it from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> 
to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>.
The <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> will show to me a receipt that includes a (unique) <em>TOKENID</em>, 
to be used in the <i>car pick up</i> phase.</li>
</ul>

As a <bc>client - car pick up phase</bc> :
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> to submit the request to pick up my car, by sending the <tt>TOKENID</tt> previously received. </li>  
<li>Afterwards, the <tt>transport trolley</tt>  takes over my car and moves it from its <tt>parking-slot</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.</li>
<li>I move the car, so to free the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>.
</li>
 </ul>

As a <bc>parking-manager</bc>:
<ul>
<li>I intend to use the <em>ParkServiceStatusGUI</em>  provided by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>
to observe the <em>current state</em> of the <tt>parking area</tt>, including the value <tt>TA</tt> of the temperature,
the state of the <tt>fan</tt> and the state of the <tt>transport trolley</tt> (<k>idle, working or stopped</k>).</li>
<li>I intend to <em>stop</em> the <tt>transport trolley</tt> when <k>TA > TMAX</k>, activate the <tt>fan</tt> and 
wait until <k>TA &lt; TMAX</k>. At this time, I stop the <tt>fan</tt> and resume the behavior of the <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
Hopefully, the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the fan</ks> could also be automated by the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>,
while the <b>start/stop</b> <ks>of the transport trolley</ks> is always up to me.
</li>

<li>I expect that the <tt>ParkManagerService</tt> sends to me an <em>alarm</em> if it detectes that the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt>
has not been cleaned within the <tt>DTFREE</tt> interval of time.</li>
</ul>
 
 
<h3>Requirements </h3>

The <tt>ParkManagerService</tt>  should create the <tt>ParkServiceGUI</tt> (for the client) 
and the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> (for the manager) and then perform the following tasks:


<ul>
 
<li><hr/>
<em>acceptIN</em>: accept the request of a client to park the car if there is at least one <tt>parking-slot</tt> available,
select a free slot identified with a unique <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.<br/>
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is free</k>, 
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager). 
If the <tt>INDOOR-area</tt> is already engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed 
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice). 
<br/>
  <li><em>informIN</em>: inform the client about the value of the <tt>SLOTNUM</tt>.</li> 
If  <k>SLOTNUM>0</k>:
  <ol>
   <li><em>moveToIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>INDOOR</tt> ;</li>
  <li><em>receipt</em>: send to the client a receipt including the value of the <tt>TOKENID</tt> ;</li> 
  <li><em>moveToSlotIn</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from the <tt>INDOOR</tt> to the selected <tt>parking-slot</tt>;</li>
  <!-- <li>accept another request (<tt>acceptIN</tt> or <tt>acceptOUT</tt>). -->
  <li><em>backToHome</em>: if no other request is present,  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location,
  else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em>.</li> 
  </ol>
 </li>
If <k>SLOTNUM==0</k>: 
	<ul>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if not already at home, move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location.</li> 
	</ul>
</li>


<li><hr/>
<em>acceptOUT</em>: accept the request of a client to get out the car with <tt>TOKENID</tt>.
A request of this type can be elaborated only when the <k><tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is free</k> 
and  the <tt>transport trolley</tt> is at <tt>home</tt> or working (<k>not stopped</k> by the manager).
If the <tt>OUTDOOR-area</tt> is still engaged by a car, the request is not immediately processed 
(the client could simply wait or could - optionally - receive a proper notice).

	<ol>
	<li><em>findSlot</em>: deduce the number of the parking slot (<em>CARSLOTNUM</em>) from the <tt>TOKENID</tt>;</li>
	<li><em>moveToSlotOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> from its current localtion to the <tt>CARSLOTNUM/parking-slot</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToOut</em>: move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to the <tt>OUTDOOR</tt> ;</li>
	<li><em>moveToHome</em>: if no other request is present  move the <tt>transport trolley</tt> to its <tt>home</tt> location; <br/>
	else <em>acceptIN</em> or <em>acceptOUT</em></li> 

	</ol> 
</li>
<li>
<hr/>
<em>monitor</em>: update the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> with the required information about the state of the system.
</li>

<li>
<hr/>
<em>manage</em>: accept the request of the manager to stop/resume the behavior of the  <tt>transport trolley</tt>.
</li>

</ul>
<h4>About the devices</h4>
All the sensors (<tt>weigthsensor</tt>, <tt>outsonar</tt>, <tt>thermometer</tt> ) and the <tt>fan</tt> should be properly simulated
by mock-objects or mock-actors.

<h4>When using a real robot</h4>
No further requirement.

<h4>When available a Raspberry and a sonar</h4>
The <tt>outsonar</tt> could be a real device. We can simulate the presence/absence of a car.

    <h4>When using <k>only</k> the virtual robot or <k>no real sonar</k> available</h4>
Consider the new requirement:
<ul>
<li><ks>authorize</ks>: allow a manager to use the <tt>ParkServiceStatusGUI</tt> only if she/he owns <bc>proper permissions</bc>.</li>
 
</ul>
 

 

<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
During a meeting with the client the following definitions are clarified: 
<ul>
<li><ks>transport trolley</ks>: a DDR robot able to move a car. The car will be loaded on a platform placed behind or in front of the robot.</li>
<li><ks>home location</ks>: position where the robot starts when the system is started. Located in the upper left corner, facing south.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-area</ks>: the area where the robot can move and the cars can park. People cannot access this area. This area is surrounded by walls, except for an entrance and an exit.</li>
<li><ks>indoor-area</ks>: area where the car arrive, and the robot can take it. This area is equipped with a weight sonar</li>
<li><ks>weightsensor</ks>: device that can detect the weight above it.</li>
<li><ks>outdoor-area</ks>: area where the robot carries a car following a picking request. This area must be cleared by the user within the time DTFREE.  </li>
<li><ks>outsonar</ks>: device capable of detect if the outdoor-area is free or not. </li>
<li><ks>parking-slots</ks>: places where cars can be parked. The transport trolley cannot transit on these slots. </li>
<li><ks>thermometer</ks>: device capable of detect the temperature of the parking area. </li>
<li><ks>fan</ks>: device capable of reducing the temperature of the parking area. </li>
<li><ks>map</ks>: map of the area, the locations marked with the symbol X represents the walls or the parking slots, the location marked with "r" represents the actual position of the transport trolley. </li>
<li><ks>fixed obstacles</ks>: the walls. No other obstacles are present in the area.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-manager</ks>: human being which supervises the state of the parking-area and handles critical situations.  </li>
<li><ks>tokenid</ks>: numeric identifier that allows you to refer to the parking number and pickup the car.  </li>
<li><ks>robot</ks>: a device capable of moving by receiving commands via the network, as reported in
<a href="VirtualRobot2021.html#commands" target="web">VirtualRobot2021.html</a>.
 </li>

</ul>

Regarding actions (verbs):
<ul>
<li><ks>stop (of the robot)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is higher then TMAX, the parking manager disables robot operations. If the robot was moving, it will have to stop immediately. </li>
<li><ks>start (of the fan)</ks>: when the robot has stopped, the parking manager must turn on the fan.  </li>
<li><ks>stop (of the fan)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is lower then TMAX, the parking manager can turn off the fan.  </li>
<li><ks>start (of the robot)</ks>: when the temperature detected by thermometer is lower then TMAX and the fan is turned off, the parking manager can turn on the robot.  </li>
<li><ks>parking-area</ks>: the area where the robot can move and the cars can park. People cannot access this area. This area is surrounded by walls, except for an entrance and an exit.</li>
<li><ks>indoor-area</ks>: area where the car arrive, and the robot can take it. This area is equipped with a weight sonar</li>
</ul>



<h2>Problem analysis</h2>
<h3>Problems identified</h3>

<ol>
<li><h4>Moving the car from the indoor area</h4>
When the robot picks up the car from the indoor, the car is outside the walls. In this case, particular attention must be paid during handling. A rotation of the robot in this position could cause the machine to hit the wall.
After a meeting with the client, he clarified that this can be overlooked.
</li>

<li><h4>Weight-sensor</h4>
To prevent an object other than a car from entering the parking-area and interfering with the system, it is necessary to establish a threshold below which the entry is not allowed. The value of this threshold will be decided in the following stages.
</li>

<li><h4>Dimensions of the car</h4>
To prevent a large car from occupying more than one parking space, it is assumed that all cars entering the parking area have a maximum length RD. So, they occupy only 1 cell of the map.
</li>

<li><h4>Stop of the robot during operations</h4>
In the event that the robot is stopped by the operator during a movement operation, the robot must stop in the position in which it is.
When conditions allow, the robot's operations will have to resume where they left off.
It is assumed that the customer waits for the robot to resume execution, ending the process.
</li>

</ol>

<h3>SPRINT 1</h3>
As a first sprint we have introduced the following simplifications:
<ul>
<li><ks>no sensors</ks>: no sensor will be simulated during this phase (thermometer, weight-sensor, outsonar). </li>
<li><ks>no connection with the robot</ks>: the robot will not make any movement. The actions will be simulated considering a waiting time.  </li>
<li><ks>GUI not implemented</ks>: The parking manager and parking service gui will not be implemented in this first phase. </li>
<li><ks>no alarm</ks>: Since there is no sonar, we assume that all cars will be removed within the DTFREE time. </li>

</ul>It is assumed that the parking request is sent only if there is at least one free space. This filter will be charged to the GUI which will not forward any CAR ENTER type request in case of all slot are occupied.

<h4>Logical Architecture</h4>

<table style="width:100%" border="1">
				<tbody><tr>
					<td style="width:50%;">Our system, as a first sprint, is composed by two actor: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><ks>door: </ks>this actor manage the entrance and the exit of the car to/from the parcking-area, before performing actions checks the robot status. In this first phase the robot can assume two different status (idle, working). Stop status is not handled now.</li>
<li><ks>client: </ks> this actor simulate the actions of CARENTER and pickup of the car. </li>
